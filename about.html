            <h1>What is it all about?</h1>
            <p><b>'Samsara'</b> is an immersive multisensory visual art exhibition, accompanied by spatial soundscapes that explores the evolution in our fragile and beautiful world. </p>
            <p>The project seamlessly melds generative graphics in monochrome, imaginative microscopy, sonic experimentation, and tangible real-world objects to illuminate the multifaceted facets of continuous transformation. These processes embedded in the tapestry of natural phenomena, culture, society, and the human experience. This experience evokes contemplation on the philosophical musings of existence and creates meditative metamorphosis through poetical visuals, which goes beyond the limits of the computer-generated image and leads us back into a world of imperfection and enchantment.</p>
